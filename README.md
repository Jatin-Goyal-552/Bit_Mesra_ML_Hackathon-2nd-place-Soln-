<h3>Team Name :- Still Learning</h3>
<h3>This repository contain our solution(2nd place) of the Machine Learning Contest organized by BIT Mesra in which we have to create predictive models to predict the stage of liver Cirrhosis using 18 clinical features as Cirrhosis damages the liver from a variety of causes leading to
scarring and liver failure.</h3>
<h3> The full solution is described in the final report. </h3>
